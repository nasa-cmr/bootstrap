# cmr-bootstrap-app

Bootstrap is a CMR application that can bootstrap the CMR with data from Catalog REST. It has API methods for copying data from Catalog REST to the metadata db. It can also bulk index everything in the Metadata DB.

#### leiningen commands - used to create/remove user for bootstrap jobs

1. Create the user

```
lein create-user
```

2. Run the migration scripts

```
lein migrate
```

You can use `lein migrate -version version` to restore the database to
a given version. `lein migrate -version 0` will clean the datbase
completely.

3. Remove the user

```
lein drop-user
```

#### java commands through uberjar

1. Create the user

```
CMR_DB_URL=thin:@localhost:1521:orcl CMR_BOOTSTRAP_DB_PASSWORD=****** java -cp target/cmr-bootstrap-app-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar cmr.db create-user
```

2. Run db migration

```
CMR_DB_URL=thin:@localhost:1521:orcl CMR_BOOTSTRAP_DB_PASSWORD=****** java -cp target/cmr-bootstrap-app-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar cmr.db migrate
```

You can provider additional arguments to migrate the database to a given version as in lein migrate.

3. Remove the user

```
CMR_DB_URL=thin:@localhost:1521:orcl CMR_BOOTSTRAP_DB_PASSWORD=****** java -cp target/cmr-bootstrap-app-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar cmr.db drop-user


## Example curls

### Bulk copy provider FIX_PROV1 and all it's collections and granules to the metadata db

    curl -v -XPOST  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"provider_id": "FIX_PROV1"}' http://localhost:3006/bulk_migration/providers

For the echo-reverb test fixture data, the following curl can be used to check metadata db
to make sure the new data is available:

    curl -v http://localhost:3001/concepts/G1000000033-FIX_PROV1

This should return the granule including the echo-10 xml.

### Copy a single collection's granules

    curl -v -XPOST  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"provider_id": "FIX_PROV1", "collection_id": "C1000000073-FIX_PROV1"}' http://localhost:3006/bulk_migration/collections

### Bulk index a provider

  	curl -v -XPOST  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"provider_id": "FIX_PROV1"}' http://localhost:3006/bulk_index/providers

### Synchronize Catalog REST and CMR

Due to an issue in Catalog REST the CMR and Catalog REST databases diverged for a period of time because no ingest (new items, updates or deletes) were sent to the CMR. There is a mechanism for synchronizing the CMR with Catalog REST using the following endpoint:

    curl -v -XPOST http://localhost:3006/db_synchronize?start_date=2014-10-01T00:00:00Z&end_date=2014-10-05T00:00:00Z

The following parameters are supported. All parameters are optional.

  * `start_date`: The start date of the range to look for time changes. Uses ingest_updated_at column.
  * `end_date`: The end date of the range to look for time changes. Uses ingest_updated_at column.
  * `provider_id`: Limit the synchronization to a specific provider.
  * `entry_title`: Limit the synchronization to a specific collection. If this is provided `provider_id` must also be provided.

This will start a synchronization process in the background and return immediately. The synchronization process iterates over each provider and executes the following steps:

  1. Synchronize missing collections
  2. Synchronize deleted collections
  3. Synchronize missing granules
  4. Synchronize deleted granules

#### Synchronizing Missing Items

  1. It finds any items in the Catalog REST database matching the params. These items are inserted into a table for processing.
  2. For each batch of N items from the work table:
     1. Get the latest revision ids of the items from the work table.
     2. For each item in the batch:
       1. Select the data from Catalog REST.
       2. Ingest it into Metadata DB with the expected revision id (latest revision id + 1)
         * An error could occur in this step if an ingest occurred after the revision id was retrieved. Metadata DB would reject are insert saying the revision id conflicted. We skip this item in this case as we've already received newer metadata.
       3. Index the item using the indexer.

Note that for every item found between start_date and end_date a new revision will be saved to Metadata DB

#### Synchronizing Deleted Items

  1. It finds any items which exist in Metadata DB and do not exist in Catalog REST. These items are inserted into a table for processing. The latest revision ids are retrieved at the same time.
    * The start and end date parameters are ignored for this.
  2. For each batch of N items from the work table:
     1. For each item in the batch:
       1. Create a tombstone in Metadata DB
         * An error could occur in this step if an ingest or delete occurred after the revision id was retrieved. Metadata DB would reject the tombstone saying the revision id conflicted. We skip this item in this case as we've already received a more recent update.
       2. Unindex the item using the indexer


**Important** - This endpoint does not validate that there isn't a database synchronization already running. Do not run it multiple times in a row unless you're sure it's not running currently. This will cause issues if you attempt to run it on multiple hosts since the work tables are truncated during processing.

**Important** - Metadata DB jobs should be paused before running synchronization. This can be accomplished with the following query:

curl -v -XPOST -H "Echo-Token: mock-echo-system-token" http://localhost:3001/jobs/pause

The Metadata DB jobs can be resumed after synchronziation has completed with the following query:

curl -v -XPOST -H "Echo-Token: mock-echo-system-token" http://localhost:3001/jobs/resume

These require a token with UPDATE ingest management permission.

### Pause Jobs

params: none
returns: nothing (status 204)

    curl -v -XPOST http://localhost:3006/jobs/pause

### Resume Jobs

params: none
returns: nothing (status 204)

    curl -v -XPOST http://localhost:3006/jobs/resume

### Check application health

This will report the current health of the application. It checks all resources and services used by the application and reports their healthes in the response body in JSON format. For resources, the report includes an "ok?" status and a "problem" field if the resource is not OK. For services, the report includes an overall "ok?" status for the service and health reports for each of its dependencies. It returns HTTP status code 200 when the application is healthy, which means all its interfacing resources and services are healthy; or HTTP status code 503 when one of the resources or services is not healthy. It also takes pretty parameter for pretty printing the response.

    curl -i -XGET "http://localhost:3006/health?pretty=true"

Example healthy response body:

```
{
  "metadata-db" : {
    "ok?" : true,
    "dependencies" : {
      "oracle" : {
        "ok?" : true
      },
      "echo" : {
        "ok?" : true
      }
    }
  },
  "internal-metadata-db" : {
    "ok?" : true,
    "dependencies" : {
      "oracle" : {
        "ok?" : true
      },
      "echo" : {
        "ok?" : true
      }
    }
  },
  "indexer" : {
    "ok?" : true,
    "dependencies" : {
      "elastic_search" : {
        "ok?" : true
      },
      "echo" : {
        "ok?" : true
      },
      "metadata-db" : {
        "ok?" : true,
        "dependencies" : {
          "oracle" : {
            "ok?" : true
          },
          "echo" : {
            "ok?" : true
          }
        }
      },
      "index-set" : {
        "ok?" : true,
        "dependencies" : {
          "elastic_search" : {
            "ok?" : true
          },
          "echo" : {
            "ok?" : true
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Example un-healthy response body:

```
{
  "metadata-db" : {
    "ok?" : true,
    "dependencies" : {
      "oracle" : {
        "ok?" : true
      },
      "echo" : {
        "ok?" : true
      }
    }
  },
  "internal-metadata-db" : {
    "ok?" : true,
    "dependencies" : {
      "oracle" : {
        "ok?" : true
      },
      "echo" : {
        "ok?" : true
      }
    }
  },
  "indexer" : {
    "ok?" : false,
    "dependencies" : {
      "elastic_search" : {
        "ok?" : false,
        "problem" : {
          "status" : "Inaccessible",
          "problem" : "Unable to get elasticsearch cluster health, caught exception: Connection refused"
        }
      },
      "echo" : {
        "ok?" : true
      },
      "metadata-db" : {
        "ok?" : true,
        "dependencies" : {
          "oracle" : {
            "ok?" : true
          },
          "echo" : {
            "ok?" : true
          }
        }
      },
      "index-set" : {
        "ok?" : false,
        "problem" : {
          "elastic_search" : {
            "ok?" : false,
            "problem" : {
              "status" : "Inaccessible",
              "problem" : "Unable to get elasticsearch cluster health, caught exception: Connection refused"
            }
          },
          "echo" : {
            "ok?" : true

        }
      }
    }
  }
}
